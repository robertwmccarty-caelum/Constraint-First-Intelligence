def measure_stability(previous_model, new_model, data):

    Measure the stability of model swaps between a previous model and a new model.

    Args:
        previous_model: The previous model instance for comparison.
        new_model: The new model instance for analysis.
        data: The dataset to evaluate the models against.

    Returns:
        A placeholder value representing the swap stability assessment (to be implemented).

    Compare metrics derived from two models to assess performance variation.

        metric_previous: Metrics of the previous model.
        metric_new: Metrics of the new model.
