# Π_Projector Experiments (Phase 2)

These experiments are **observational only**.
They do not modify invariants, projection logic, or automaton behavior.

Purpose:
- Measure stability, continuity, and governance properties
- Validate Π_Projector invariants under stress
- Enable falsifiable, repeatable analysis

All experiments are:
- Model-agnostic
- Read-only
- Metrics-driven
