# Constraint-First-Intelligence
Alignment as Geometric Projection

> Constraint-first researcher · Systems-minded ML engineer · Open-source builder

I build **constraint-first intelligence systems** — architectures where capability is learned, but **continuity, safety, and identity are enforced**.  
My work focuses on making intelligent systems *predictable, auditable, and stable over time*, even as models change.

I publish in public, prototype aggressively, and turn promising ideas into reference implementations with clear specifications and testable guarantees.

---

## 🔭 What I work on
- Constraint-first AI architectures (alignment as projection, not training)
- Deterministic governance layers for LLMs and agents
- Memory, identity, and safety enforced via external invariants
- Research systems that are falsifiable, auditable, and model-agnostic

---

## 🛠️ Core skills & tools
- **Languages:** Python, TypeScript, Rust  
- **ML / Research:** PyTorch, JAX, scikit-learn, embedding & NLI models  
- **Systems:** Docker, CI/CD, cloud infra, reproducible experiments  
- **Design:** Constraint programming, optimization, safety & alignment  
- **Practice:** Testing, receipts/audit logs, spec-driven development

## 🚀 Featured project

### 🔹 Constraint-First-Intelligence (Π_Projector)  
**Repository:** [Constraint-First-Intelligence](https://github.com/robertwmccarty-caelum/Constraint-First-Intelligence)

A **model-agnostic governance architecture** that treats AI alignment as a geometric projection problem rather than a training objective.

Key ideas:
- Alignment as projection over immutable invariants
- Minimal Unsatisfiable Sets (MUS) for explainable refusals
- Deterministic, monotonic repair
- Typed Clarification Requests instead of vague refusals
- Cryptographic memory & predicate receipts
- Measurable governance metrics (CRR, ATR, stability)

This repo serves as a **canonical reference implementation** for constraint-first intelligence systems.

---

## 📈 What you’ll find in my repos
- Reference architectures and formal specs  
- Deterministic repair and governance code  
- Experiments that test stability across model swaps  
- Design docs, notebooks, and implementation notes  
- Code intended to be **read, audited, and extended**

---

## 🤝 Collaboration
I enjoy collaborating with:
- AI safety & alignment researchers
- Systems and infra engineers
- Teams building production LLM tooling

I’m open to:
- Research collaboration
- Design reviews and technical advising
- Select consulting or contracting (architecture-level work)

## 🧠 Philosophy
> Capability can be learned.  
> **Continuity must be enforced.**

I’m interested in systems that don’t just work *now*, but remain correct, explainable, and governable as they scale.

Thanks for stopping by.

If you want, I can:
- Add dynamic GitHub stats / top-language cards
- Pin and highlight additional repositories
- Insert badges (availability, contact, languages)
- Add screenshots, GIFs, or diagrams and short walk-throughs
- Produce a compact minimalist variant or a more visual portfolio variant

Tell me which elements to add and provide any missing details below — I’ll produce the final polished README ready to paste into your profile repo.

Please provide the items below so I can finish and personalize the README:

1. Preferred display name and pronouns (if any).
2. Contact links to include (email, website, LinkedIn, X/Twitter, Mastodon, GitHub Sponsors, etc.) — paste full URLs.
3. Are you open to work / available for hire? If yes, what types of engagements (research, consulting, contracting, full-time)?
4. Any additional projects to feature (repo links + 1–2 sentence descriptions each).
5. Do you want dynamic widgets/cards (GitHub stats, top languages, streaks)? (Yes / No — if yes, which ones)
6. Any visual assets to include (profile image, project screenshots, GIFs, logos) — paste URLs.
7. Preferred README style: Minimalist · Technical · Portfolio · Other (specify).
8. Where should I place the final file? (profile repo name, e.g., `robertwmccarty-caelum/robertwmccarty-caelum`)
