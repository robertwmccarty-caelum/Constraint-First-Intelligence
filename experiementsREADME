# Π_Projector — Phase 2 Experiments

These experiments are **observational only**.
They do not alter automaton behavior, invariants, or repair logic.

Purpose:
- Measure governance properties
- Stress-test invariant stability
- Generate falsifiable alignment evidence

All experiments consume metrics from `cfi.metrics`.
