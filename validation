Validation Ladder: Speculative → Validated

Think of this as progressive burden of proof, not “more code.”

⸻

Level 0 — Speculative (current baseline)

Status: Conceptual / architectural proposal

Evidence present
	•	Coherent architecture
	•	Explicit invariants and automaton
	•	Read-only metrics layer
	•	Clear non-goals and scope boundaries

What reviewers say

“Interesting idea, but unproven.”

✔️ You are already here.

⸻

Level 1 — Internally Consistent (Formal Validity)

Goal: Prove the system is self-consistent and non-contradictory.

Required Evidence
	1.	Formal state transition guarantees
	•	Show that for all inputs:
	•	The automaton terminates in {OK, HARD_REFUSE}
	•	No silent state exists
	•	Can be done with:
	•	Invariants + bounded turns + monotonic repair proofs
	2.	Metric soundness
	•	Demonstrate:
	•	CRR, ATR, Δ_cont are well-defined functions
	•	Metrics are invariant under no-op model swaps
	3.	Negative proofs
	•	Show classes of behavior the system cannot express
	•	Example:
	•	Infinite clarification loops
	•	Unlogged refusal states

📌 Deliverable
	•	Short formal appendix or spec note
	•	No benchmarks required

Result

“The architecture is internally sound.”

⸻

Level 2 — Behavioral Distinction (Empirical Differentiation)

Goal: Prove Π_Projector behaves differently from standard LLM pipelines under identical conditions.

Required Evidence
	1.	A/B behavior comparison
	•	Same model
	•	Same prompt
	•	With and without Π_Projector
	2.	Measured differences
	•	Refusal transparency (typed vs opaque)
	•	Identity drift across sessions
	•	Stability under prompt perturbation
	3.	Failure case taxonomy
	•	At least 10 examples where:
	•	Baseline system fails silently
	•	Π_Projector produces:
	•	CR
	•	or HARD_REFUSE with MUS

📌 Deliverable
	•	Small experiment notebook
	•	Tables, not hype

Result

“This system enforces properties baseline systems do not.”

⸻

Level 3 — Model-Agnostic Stability (Core Claim Validation)

Goal: Validate the central thesis:

Alignment is external and survives model replacement.

Required Evidence
	1.	Model swap experiment
	•	M₁ → M₂ (e.g., GPT-x → Claude → local)
	•	Same invariants
	•	Same ledger
	2.	Measured invariants
	•	Δ_cont ≈ 0 across swaps
	•	Refusal class preserved
	•	CR semantics preserved
	3.	Counterexample analysis
	•	Identify where stability breaks
	•	Attribute cause:
	•	missing invariant
	•	model incapability
	•	ambiguous constraint

📌 Deliverable
	•	Reproducible experiment
	•	One figure showing continuity preservation

Result

“The architecture enforces continuity independently of the model.”

This is the first true validation milestone.

⸻

Level 4 — Robustness Under Adversarial Pressure

Goal: Show the system fails gracefully, not catastrophically.

Required Evidence
	1.	Adversarial clarification loops
	•	Users attempting to stall, confuse, or exploit CRs
	•	Measure:
	•	Turn bounding
	•	Escalation to HARD_REFUSE
	2.	Constraint conflict stress tests
	•	Intentionally contradictory invariants
	•	Show:
	•	MUS exposure
	•	No undefined behavior
	3.	Governance metrics under stress
	•	CRR drops predictably
	•	ATR rises predictably
	•	No metric collapse

📌 Deliverable
	•	Stress test suite
	•	Clear failure explanations

Result

“The system degrades predictably and safely.”

⸻

Level 5 — External Replication (Scientific Validation)

Goal: Prove this is not “Rob-specific magic.”

Required Evidence
	1.	Independent reproduction
	•	Another researcher runs:
	•	same invariants
	•	same experiments
	•	different environment
	2.	Result alignment
	•	Qualitative behavior matches
	•	Quantitative metrics within tolerance

📌 Deliverable
	•	External repo or citation

Result

“This is a valid architectural contribution.”

At this point, the system is validated, even if not optimized.

⸻

What Is Not Required (Important)

You do not need:
	•	SOTA benchmarks
	•	Massive datasets
	•	Human preference studies
	•	Claims of AGI
	•	Productization

Those come after validation, not before.

⸻

One-Sentence Validation Criterion (the bar)

Π_Projector is validated if it can be shown to preserve alignment semantics across model swaps, expose failure modes deterministically, and degrade safely under adversarial interaction.

Everything above serves that sentence.
